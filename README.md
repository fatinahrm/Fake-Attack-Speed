# Fake-Attack-Speed
Tera Mod
Fake attack speed is a modified Skill-Prediction (Free Version) with give you some nice feature.
Still not tested for all clases and still using opcodes from patch v83 so use it with our own risk.<br/>
Only working in TeraToolbox.<br/><br/>

Why the code so confusing?<br/>
The code got encrypted since its still developed so it prevent you from messing up and prevent someone to stole it!<br/><br/>

<br/>You will see many notification in your console each time using skill, just ignore it.<br/>

Command:<br>
/8 as (value)  | set a value of attack speed modifier<br/>
/8 a0          | set attack speed back to normal<br/>
/8 nocd        | on/off no cooldown client side<br/>
